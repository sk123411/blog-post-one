	  <h1>1. Logitech MX Anywhere 2</h1>
	  <p>Versatile and feature-packed without going overboard</p>
	  
	  <h3>DPI: 1,600 | Interface: Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless (pairs with up to three devices) | Buttons: 7 | Ergonomic: Right-handed | Features: Scrolling wheel, Logitech Darkfield Laser Tracking, Unifying receiver, Easy-Switch tech, gesture function
	  </h3>
	  
	  <p>The MX Anywhere 2 is smaller than Logitech's flagship MX Master mouse, making it a more travel-friendly option. However, we find that it's a more comfortable fit for a smaller hand and we have been using it as our main rodent in the office.

It connects using Bluetooth or 2.4Ghz wireless (using Logitech's dongle) and can connect with up to three devices. It sports low-latency tracking, aided by Logitech's Darkfield tech that makes the mouse usable on shiny surfaces. 

Like the MX Master, the scroll wheel can spin freely once you've depressed it, allowing you to scroll down long pages avoiding finger aches.

Logitech says that the Anywhere 2's non-rechargable battery will last up to 60 days on a single charge, which may be an overstatement but we haven't seen the mouse give up very often yet.
